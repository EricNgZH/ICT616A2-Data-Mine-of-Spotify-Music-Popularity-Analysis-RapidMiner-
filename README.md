# ICT616A2 Data Mine of Spotify Music Popularity Analysis (RapidMiner)

Spotify, a prominent digital music streaming service, serves millions of users globally with an extensive library of music and audio content. Founded in 2006, it has risen to become one of the premier platforms for music streaming.

For this project, we've selected the Spotify 1 Million Songs Dataset, sourced from Kaggle. This dataset offers a treasure trove of insights into music preferences, audio feature trends, and the factors that influence a song's popularity. To make our analysis computationally manageable, we've focused on a 10% subset of the data, specifically from 2022, encompassing 5.3K data points. This subset allows us to highlight the latest music trends.

Our primary goal in this 2022 analysis is to uncover recent music track characteristics and trends, explore the elements impacting track popularity, and decipher how various attributes influence user reception.

Spotify relies on understanding user preferences and track popularity to enhance personalized recommendations, optimize its music library, and improve monetization strategies. Through rigorous data mining, we aim to identify the musical attributes that resonate most with users, leading to refined recommendations, higher user engagement, and better playlist curation.
